# BreweryRecipes
This is an addon for BreweryX which adds physical recipes to the game
alongside a recipe book/gui to view them.

This addon is very nice for if you want your players to be able
to discover recipes and view them later in a flexible way.

This plugin uses a permissions plugin to store rhe permission node to view the recipe.
SQLite or MySQL support may be a thing in the future (maybe ask in the discord if your setup requires it?)
